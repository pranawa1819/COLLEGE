        <h1>Welcome to Maiti Nepal</h1>
        <p>Making the world a better place, one step at a time.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Maiti is a beautiful word from the Nepali language, meaning a woman’s childhood home. Apart from being a beautiful word that evokes memories and a feeling of comfort, Maiti is a concept that many Nepali women carry close to their hearts.
            Founded in 1993, Maiti Nepal carries the same concept and space for women that they bear close to their heart for the word ‘Maiti.’ Maiti Nepal is the place where women who have been trafficked, exploited, abused, or had their rights denied in any form can find a home for themselves. Headquartered in Kathmandu, Maiti Nepal is a non-profit, secular organization working to protect and improve the lives of vulnerable individuals and rescue survivors. The organization promotes children’s and women’s rights and aims to put an end to trafficking through these key activity sectors: 2A’s advocacy and awareness, 6P’s prevention, protection, participation, prosecution, partnership and policy, 5R’s rescue, repatriation, rehabilitation, reintegration and referral. It seeks to build awareness and secure cooperation from schools and college students, parliamentarians, federal, provincial, and local governments, law enforcement agencies and organizations in Nepal, and their counterparts in India.
            Maiti Nepal, today, conducts a wide range of activities. Organizing awareness campaigns, community sensitization programs, rescue operations, apprehending traffickers, providing legal support to the needy, women empowerment programs, training, providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to children and women infected by HIV are regular activities of the organization.</p>
        <h2>Birth of Maiti Nepal</h2>
          <p>x  Maiti Nepal was born out of the conscious efforts of teachers, journalists, and social workers who banded together to fight social evils inflicted upon women. Spearheaded by the founder, Anuradha Koirala, the organization began in 1993. The primary focus of the organization is preventing trafficking for forced prostitution, rescuing survivors of the flesh trade, and rehabilitating rescued women.
            Alongside, Maiti Nepal also actively works to provide justice for victimized girls and women through criminal investigation and conducts legal cases against offenders. For close to three decades, the organization has drastically highlighted the issue of trafficking with strong advocacy from local, national, and international levels.</p>
